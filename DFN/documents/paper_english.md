## **Abstract**

We introduce **Dynamic Flow Networks (DFN)**, a novel AI architecture that replaces the three classic pillars of the Transformer world: *discrete tokens*, *dot-product attention*, and *fixed positional encodings*. DFN stands on three essential components:

1. **Dynamic Flow Attention (DFA)**  
2. **Continuous Entities (CE)**  
3. **FlowNorm & Persistent Field Memory**

This framework models information as a continuous field, where entities move, cluster, and dynamically transform based on learned semantic flows. DFN maintains sub-quadratic complexity and enables seamless adaptation to multimodal and arbitrarily long inputs.

## **1. Introduction**

Transformers rule modern AI but show three major limitations: (1) rigid discrete tokens, (2) $O(n^2)$ attention bottleneck, (3) predefined input positions.

**DFN discards those limits** using continuous vector flows in high-dimensional spaces. Instead of rigidly processing sequences, it simulates the dynamic displacement of semantic entities—similar to a swarm of context-driven particles in physics.

## **2. Architecture**

### 2.1. Continuous Entities (CE)

Each input is mapped to a *continuous field* $F(x)$ from which $N$ entities are extracted:

$$
e_i = [p_i, s_i, w_i], \quad i \in [1, N]
$$

- $p_i \in \mathbb{R}^k$: space/time coordinates  
- $s_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$: latent state  
- $w_i$: influence weight

Entity sampling is *adaptive*: denser regions in $F(x)$ yield more entities.

### 2.2. Dynamic Flow Attention (DFA)

Instead of query-key dot products, each entity produces a flow vector:

$$
f_i = W_f s_i
$$

Semantic position is updated:

$$
p_i' = p_i + \alpha f_i
$$

Entities interact with only their $k$ nearest neighbors in the latent space:

$$
y_i = \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} g(\|p_i' - p_j'\|)\cdot W_v s_j
$$

where $g(\cdot)$ is a Gaussian affinity function.  
This mechanism ensures adaptive local interactions, linearithmic cost, and long-range dependency through iterative moves.

### 2.3. Flow Normalization (FlowNorm)

To prevent diverging magnitudes, DFN introduces:

$$
\mathrm{FlowNorm}(s_i) = \frac{s_i}{\sqrt{\mathbb{E}[\|f_i\|^2] + \epsilon}}
$$

FlowNorm stabilizes field dynamics throughout learning.

### 2.4. Update Module (Dynamic Field MLP)

After interaction, each entity is updated as:

$$
s_i' = \mathrm{MLP}([s_i, y_i])
$$

This block refines local information after each flow step.

### 2.5. Persistent Field Memory

A subset of entities, $M = \{m_1, \ldots, m_r\}$, is preserved over steps:

$$
m_j^{t+1} = \beta m_j^t + (1-\beta)\cdot\mathrm{Aggregate}(y)
$$

This acts as long-range **context memory**.

## **3. Training**

- **DFN** can be trained autoregressively or contrastively.
- **Text:** prediction comes from projecting recent entities onto the vocabulary:

$$
P(t) = \mathrm{softmax}(W_o \bar{s})
$$

- **Vision/audio:** density-field reconstruction.
- **Optimizer:** AdamW (warmup + cosine decay suggested).

## **4. Complexity & Properties**

- Temporal Complexity: $O(n \log n)$ (neighbor search + flows)
- No segmentation or positional embeddings needed
- Scalable: $>10^6$ context length
- Unifies text, image, audio in a geometric principle

---

## **5. Experiments (Ideas)**

1. **Language:** Outperforming transformers on long contexts ($>32,000$ tokens).
2. **Multimodal:** Text-vision, video.
3. **Ablations:** Test without flows, without persistent memory, without FlowNorm.
4. **Metrics:** Perplexity, top-k accuracy, GPU usage, numerical stability.

---

## **6. Discussion**

DFN reframes sequential tasks as **semantic particle dynamics**. No hard tokens, variable density, and geometric latent structure. Unlike transformers, DFN doesn't "attend"—it *flows* and reorganizes information in latent space.

---

## **7. Conclusions**

Dynamic Flow Networks *redefine* foundational models:

- Attention → adaptive vector flow
- Tokens → continuous entities
- Flow normalization & persistent memory

Its continuous, geometric, and scalable formulation makes it a contender for the next generation of foundation models.

## **8. Basic PyTorch Implementation**

```python
class DFNLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim, k=16, alpha=0.1):
        super().__init__()
        self.flow = nn.Linear(dim, dim)
        self.value = nn.Linear(dim, dim)
        self.mlp = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(2*dim, dim), nn.GELU(), nn.Linear(dim, dim))
        self.alpha = alpha
        self.k = k

    def forward(self, states, positions):
        f = self.flow(states)
        p_new = positions + self.alpha * f
        neighbors = knn_search(p_new, self.k)  # local search
        affinities = gaussian_affinity(p_new, neighbors)
        context = aggregate(affinities, self.value(states))
        out = self.mlp(torch.cat([states, context], dim=-1))
        return FlowNorm(out), p_new
```
